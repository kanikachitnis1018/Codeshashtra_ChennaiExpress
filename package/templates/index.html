                <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed mb-8" style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;" align="left;">Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms typically occur at night or early in the morning, making it difficult for individuals to breathe properly. Asthma affects people of all ages, and while it cannot be cured, it can be managed effectively with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. Raising awareness about asthma is crucial to ensure early detection, proper management, and improved quality of life for individuals living with this condition.</p>
